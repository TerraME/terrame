 * \brief Defines the interface for a general purpose model.
 *
 * Model Class: defines the interface for a general purpose model. Its derivatives interfaces
 * could model regions, watches, the laws that govern the behavior of some phenomenon
 * or interference resulting from the co-operation of autonomous individuals communities
 * over a given environment.
 * To implement these subclasses the programmer could make use of mathematical models,
 * for example, cells that model regions generally rectangular or hexagonal of space.
 * Simulation algorithms such as Monte Carlo simulation or simulation ran for events
 * could be used to implement the clocks. State machines like finite state automata or
 * stack of automaton could be utilized to model the behavior of phenomena. Artificial
 * intelligence techniques as agents could be utilized to simulate autonomous individuals.
